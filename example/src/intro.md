React-Validate
-------------

React-Validate aims to simplify validation, be it for forms or any other sequence of components in your React app. To do so, React-Validate provides wrapper components which allow you to write code that is easy to conceptualize and read. These components are as follows:

### **`<Validate>`**
- the basic validation wrapper you'll wrap around any component you want to keep in check

### **`<ValidateGroup>`**
- Group bunches of **`<Validate>`** and know if they're all valid or not. You can even group different bunches of **`<ValidateGroup>`** if you like to be notified if all groups are valid or not
